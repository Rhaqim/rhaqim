> _Building things that matter. Breaking things that don't._

### ⚙️ Developer Philosophy

- Clean code isn't a style, it's a statement.
- Systems should be fast, fault-tolerant, and fun to build.
- If it scales, caches, logs, and watches itself we're just getting started.

### 🧠 Interests

- Low-level systems & daemon tooling  
- Async architectures & job orchestration  
- Vector databases & data structures  
- Story engines, AI pipelines, and token-gated access  
- Multi-tenant platforms with secure API boundaries

```bash
# Languages
Go        # structured, simple, and strict
TypeScript# typed, composable, predictable
SQL       # raw, expressive, precise

# Tools & Systems
Redis     # fast and versatile
Postgres  # relational power
Docker    # containerized clarity
Podman    # daemonless by choice
Nginx     # solid as steel
```

### 🚀 What’s Next?

Silence the noise.  
Build the signal.  
Ship things that whisper elegance in their execution.
